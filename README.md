# Siamese-Model-for-whale-detection
Siamese Network for Image Similarity This Jupyter notebook shows how to use Python and TensorFlow to train and test a siamese network that compares two images and outputs a similarity score. The notebook uses a pre-trained Xception model, a custom distance layer, and a whale dataset.
